# Hateful Meme Detection

A multimodal machine learning system for detecting hateful content in memes by analyzing both image and text components.

## Overview

This project implements an advanced system for the detection of hateful memes, which combine images and text to convey hate speech or discrimination. The solution leverages state-of-the-art machine learning techniques including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for visual processing and transformer models for text analysis, creating a robust multimodal classification system.

## Features

- **Multimodal Analysis**: Processes both image and text components of memes
- **Advanced Classification**: Detects hateful vs. non-hateful content using deep learning
- **Interactive Interface**: User-friendly web application for uploading and analyzing memes
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- **Visualization Tools**: Explanatory visualizations for classification decisions
- **Feedback System**: Allows users to review and provide feedback on results

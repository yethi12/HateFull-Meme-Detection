# Hateful Meme Detection: The Challenge of Multimodal Learning

This repository contains a comprehensive blog-style Jupyter notebook exploring the challenge of hateful meme detection through the lens of multimodal learning. Created by Chintha Yethi Raj, this project analyzes advanced techniques for detecting hateful content in multimodal media, unpacking key insights and connecting them to the broader field of multimodal AI.

## Overview

Hateful memes represent a unique challenge for content moderation systems because they combine text and images in nuanced ways that require understanding both modalities and their interaction. This blog explores:

- The motivation behind studying hateful meme detection
- Historical perspective on multimodal learning evolution
- Technical implementation details with code examples
- Key learnings from advanced multimodal analysis
- Reflections on surprising insights and areas for improvement

## Repository Structure

- `hateful_meme_detection_blog.ipynb`: The main blog post in Jupyter notebook format

## Topics Covered

- Problem formulation in hateful meme detection
- Data understanding and dataset characteristics
- Multimodal architecture design (two-branch approach)
- Training strategies including transfer learning
- Evaluation methods and error analysis
- Future directions for improvement
